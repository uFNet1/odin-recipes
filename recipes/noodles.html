    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      For this one pan tipsy chicken and noodle recipe, the pasta is cooked
      right in the skillet in a bourbon flavored sauce - one of the best and
      easiest dinners I've made in a long time.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1 1/4 pounds boneless chicken breasts or tenders, cut into 1-inch pieces
      </li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 3/4 cups chicken stock or water, plus more as needed</li>
      <li>1/4 cup bourbon</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon neural oil</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>4 green onions, sliced, whites and green parts separated</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper</li>
      <li>8 ounces linguine pasta</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Season chicken with garlic powder, paprika, salt and pepper and toss
        well to coat. Whisk together stock, bourbon, soy sauce, ketchup and
        ginger and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add
        chicken and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned on all sides
        (chicken will not be cooked through at this point). Remove chicken from
        skillet and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add butter to skillet and melt over medium-high heat. Add the white
        parts of the green onions and garlic and cook, stirring constantly, 1
        minute. Add crushed red pepper and pasta and stir to coat in butter
        mixture. Pour in reserved bourbon mixture and stir until everything is
        well incorporated, scraping any browned bits from the bottom of the
        skillet. Bring mixture to a boil and reduce to simmer, stirring often to
        keep the noodles from sticking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add chicken and any accumulated juices into the skillet. Stir and cook,
        stirring occasionally, until pasta is cooked and sauce has thickened, 10
        to 12 minutes. Add additional stock or water as needed to keep the
        mixture saucy until pasta is cooked. Season to taste with salt. Stir in
        green onions and serve immediately.
      </li>
    </ol>
